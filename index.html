In this website, we will be exploring the applications of differential
equations to disease modeling. Alongside a basic knowledge of calculus,
this website should be helpful in teaching how to create and evaluate an
original SIR model. This website starts with basic information of what
differential equations are, and it moves to discuss the SIR model and
its specific applications. Code and graphical representation are used
heavily to visualize and interpret the data effectively and efficiently.

<h2>Differential Equations</h2>
<div id="introduction" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><br></p>
<p>The type of model that we use to predict the progression of various
diseases uses systems of differential equations. Differential equations
are equations that involve a derivative, and systems are multiple
differential equations comprising one larger model.</p>
<p>The basis of differential equations is that they show how a given
function or functions change over time, but sometimes they can be rather
difficult to solve. However, there is three main ways to solve
differential equations: numerically, analytically, and quantitatively.
In the rest of this research, we rely heavily on numerical methods, but
quantitative and analytical methods can also be used.</p>
<p>Additionally, equilibrium analysis is an important concept within the
modeling of diseases. In equilibrium analysis, we evalute the long term
behavior of a system, often using graphical representations. We seek to
find the equilibrium point of a system. The equilibrium point is the
point when you start at it, you will never move from it.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-numerical-method" class="section level3">
<h3>The Numerical Method</h3>
<p><br></p>
<p>The numerical method is great for solving very complex systems of
differential equations if a computer is able to be used, otherwise, the
process can be a bit tedious.</p>
<p>To udnerstand how the numerical method works, first look at euler’s
method of aproximation. This method takes into account the basic ideas
of calculcus. If given a system of differential equations <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{dx}{dt}=f(t,y,x), \frac{dy}{dt} =
g(t,y,x)\)</span> and the intital value <span
class="math inline">\(x(0)=a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y(0)=b\)</span> we can use the form <span
class="math inline">\(y_{k+1}=y_{k}+\delta tf(t,y,x),
x_{k+1}=x_{k}+\delta tf(t_{k},y_{k},x_{k})\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\delta t\)</span> is the timesteps. In essense
this method uses the changin rate at a point <span
class="math inline">\(y_{k}\)</span> and uses it to predict the value of
<span class="math inline">\(y_{k+1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using this, an approximation can be made on the values of x and y at
various timesteps. However, this method can be improved by taking very
small timesteps and allowing a computer to calculate with more
precision. In this case, an ordinary differential equations (ode) solver
can be used. The following systems of differential equations will be
used as an example.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{dx}{dt}= \frac{1}{5}x + 3xy\\
\frac{dy}{dt} = 4y - 2xy\]</span></p>
<p>With the initial condition of <span
class="math inline">\(x(0)=1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y(0) = 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>An ordinary differential equations (ode) solver can be used to
compute the solutions to this system numerically with much greater
accuracy.</p>
<p>First the system must be defined within the R programs model.system,
and the initial conditions will be specified. The packages used are also
called at the beginning of the code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>model.system &lt;- function(time,state,parms){
  with(as.list(c(state,parms)),{
    dx = 1 / 5 * x + 3 * x * y
    dy = 4 * y -  2 * x * y
    return(list(c(dx, dy)))
  }
  )
}

initial.conditions &lt;- c(x = 1, y = 2)</code></pre>
<p>Now, the simulation specific aspects of the code need to be added.
This icludes the size of the timesteps, the amount of timesteps, and the
function that is used to compute the solutions to the system.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dt &lt;- 0.1 
timesteps &lt;- seq(0, 1, by = dt)

simulation &lt;- as.data.frame(ode(y=initial.conditions, func = model.system,       
                                parms=model.parameters, times=timesteps))</code></pre>
<p>By using small timesteps, the accuracy of the numerical aproximations
greatly increases. Now, the data needs to be visualized. A graph can be
used, or the data can be printed our in an array of data. For simplicity
and ease of understanding, a data plot will be used to visualize the
data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plotS &lt;- ggplot() +
  geom_line(simulation,mapping=aes(x=time, y=x, color = &#39;x&#39;)) +    
  geom_line(simulation,mapping=aes(x=time, y=y, color = &#39;y&#39;)) + 
  labs(x=&quot;Timesteps&quot;, y=&quot;values&quot;, color=&#39;Legend&#39;) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) + 
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle(&quot;System 1&quot;)+
  theme(plot.margin = margin(15,15,15,15))

plotS</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From this tye of anaylsis, we can gain a lot of useful data. We can
see that as time goes on, y approaches zero. This is useful information
because a lot of times it is important to know the long term behaviro of
a system.</p>
</div>
<div id="analytical-solutions" class="section level3">
<h3>Analytical Solutions</h3>
<p><br></p>
<p>Another way of determining the solutions of systems of differential
equation is by using different methods to solve the analytically. This
method, if done correctly, is very accurate and can give an explicit
function for <span class="math inline">\(y(t)\)</span>, but it is
sometimes not possible or incredibly difficult to do. There are
countless ways to analytically solve a system of differntial
equations.</p>
</div>
<div id="qualitative-solutions" class="section level3">
<h3>Qualitative Solutions</h3>
<p><br></p>
<p>Qualitative solutions are found by examining the predicted behavior
of the system. With qualitative analysis, phase lines and slope fields
are used to predict the behavior of systems at or around equilibrium
points. This method is vital in understanding the bigger picture of what
is going on with the system as a whole, and allows visualization of the
system without tedious calcuation.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a society, we take initiative to innovate in order to explain what
was once explainable. This applied to the idea of predicting how
diseases were going to spread. In order to properly manage disease it is
vital to predict where and how the disease is going to progress. If it
is known how the disease will spread, governments, hospitals, and
citizens are able to properly allocate materials, treatments, and
manpower, and are able to take initiative to prevent the spread of
various disease. So, finding an accurate way to represent disease as at
teh forefront of many early epidemiologists’ minds.</p>
<p>The first scientist to study the spread of diseases was <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Graunt">John Graunt</a> in the
17th century. In his methods, he would rely solely on the weekly death
counts to measure how many people were dying. Graunt created documents
called The Bills of Mortality where he presented data on the births and
deaths and likely causes of death in local areas in London. He would
often rely heavily on estimate and educated guesses to predict how the
disease would spread next within the city of London. His methods and
data were often considered to be flawed due to the inaccuracies in
determining causes of death during his time. However, he set the
groundwork for later, more accurate models.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

class="uri">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q454938</a>
</p>
</div>
<p>After Graunt, epidemiologists began to take a more meticulous,
mathematical approach to modeling diseases. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli">Daniel
Bernoulli</a> was seen as the first person to take a mathematical
approach to modeling diseases. Bernoulli was a trained physician who
used mathematics to “defend the practice of inoculating against
smallpox.” His data showed that by inoculating people against smallpox,
their life expectancy could increase from around 26 years to around 29
years old.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Nowadays, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_modelling_of_infectious_disease">mathematical
models</a> are used to model two different classes of diseases:
communicable and progressive. Given recent headlines surrounding
COVID-19, the use of various methods of modeling communicable diseases
were used. A lot of them were based heavily in mathematics. One
particular use, called the SIR model, is what we will explore further in
the rest of this page. In real life, these models were used very heavily
during the COVID pandemic. The predictions made at the beginning of the
pandemic that estimated the death toll of the pandemic were calculated
mathematically in some way or another. During this pandemic, math was
used to predict the number of infected individuals, seriously ill
individuals, symptomatic individuals, asymptomatic individuals, deaths,
hospitalization,and infection rates in different age groups. Even now,
as the COVID virus is much more manageable, these mathematical models
are still being used to predict outcomes. For example, the next figure
shows the project hospitalizations of COVID-19.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

</p>
</div>
<p>These types of data representations are incredibly inportant in the
field of epidemiology. By using these matheamtical models, experts are
able to assess and manage situations in an efficient way because they
have enough information to do so. Once again, in the COVID-19 pandemic,
experts were able to implement macking, social distancing, and
vaccination requirement, because there models told them that the
pandemic could get significantly worse without them. This is largely
where the term “flattening the curve” came from. Since experts are able
to see a predicted graph of the disease progression, they are able to
implement stratgies to lessen the sudden impacts of disease and
infection.</p>
<p>In terms of modeling progressive disease, mathematics is used to
predict individual patient outcomes with diseases like ALS or
Alzheimers. With a mathematical model, a system of equations can be
derived to represtent the “extracellular plaques consisting of amyloid
β-peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of
hyperphosphorylated tau proteins” that contribute to the onset and
progression of alzheimers disease. By using past trends of the disease,
future outcomes can be predicted by using this model. This is extremely
beneficial from a pateint care persepctive, because doctors, and
families, are able to better understand howa nd when this disease will
likely affect their patients or family members.</p>
<p>However, mathematical models for diseases are not always perfect
representations of disease dynamics. These model find difficulty in the
fact that they can be oversimplified representations or they are
improper representations. The flaw in the oversimplified representation
is that they are unable to account for all factors in nature that would
be present in a normal disease, so they will never be able to model
completely effectively. Additionally, in this case, the changing nature
of disease makes it difficult to model without adjustment to the
parameters. Because disease are constantly evolving, mathematical models
can often only be used accurately for a short period of time. Also, if
the model are improper representations, they do not remain true in real
life. What this means is that the math representation either does not
make sense in real life or does not accurately represent what is
happening in real life. This can also be the result of an
oversimplification, but it can also be due to improper assumptions and
lack of knowledge in the model.</p>

<p>My name is Brennan Holst. I am a senior at West Salem High School in
West Salem, Wisconsin. I am creating this website so that other people
interested in research and in differential equations can learn more
about what I did. I have been completing research alongside Dr. Robert
Allen of the University of Wisconsin La Crosse on the application of
differential equations and the SIR model on predicting the progression
of disease relating to sociological factors This website is a display of
that research. In the future, I will be attending Northwestern
University in hopes of studying biomedical engineering and mathematics.
I hope to continue researching diseases and other topics within the real
of medicine.</p>
